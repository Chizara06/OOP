Encapsulation is the process of hiding sensitive data. It is done using access modifiers
Benefits of encapsulation:
- Protection from alteration

To access private variables, create a method

Polymorphism: The ability of objects to have multiple forms

*construtor: The 1st method that gets called during an instance of a class. Has to have the same name as the class.
 A default contructor has 0 args
*object

Access modifiers:
public
default
protected
private

Method overriding: Using an inherited method, from parent to child class
Method overloading: Multiple methods with the same name, different signatures
